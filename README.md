# Pros & Cons List App

This project is a Pros & Cons List application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to add, edit, and delete items to two separate lists (Pros and Cons) and saves the state locally. This application uses React Context and useReducer for state management and persists the data using local storage.

## Features

- Add and edit Pros and Cons with real-time updates.
- Remove items from the lists if empty.
- Automatic list management (new item added when typing in the last field).
- Uses useReducer and Context API for state management.
- Stores the list state in local storage, so the data is preserved on page reload.
- Fully responsive UI.

## Technology Stack

- React: UI library for building components.
- TypeScript: Type safety and autocompletion.
- Vite: Fast and modern build tool.
- ESLint: Linting for consistent code style.
- gh-pages: For deploying the app to GitHub Pages.
